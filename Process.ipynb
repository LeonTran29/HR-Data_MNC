    "What are the purposes of this analysis:\n",
    "- Workforce Distribution: Analyzing the demographics and structure of the workforce across different departments, locations, or roles. This could help management understand the composition of their staff and identify any imbalances.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attrition Analysis: Studying employee turnover to understand why employees are leaving the company. By analyzing data on terminated employees, an organization can identify trends and potential root causes of attrition, such as low job satisfaction or poor management.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Salary Trends: Examining salary data to identify patterns, ensure fair compensation, and detect potential pay gaps. This can be used for benchmarking salaries against industry standards or for making informed decisions on compensation adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performance Evaluation: Assessing employee performance to identify high-achievers, pinpoint areas for improvement, and link performance to other factors like salary or retention.\n",
